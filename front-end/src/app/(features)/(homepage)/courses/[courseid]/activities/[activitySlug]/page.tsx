  <p>Welcome to your first task on scaffl.ed! Imagine youâ€™re building a friendly
  virtual assistant that will greet users with a personalized message. However,
  the code your friend gave you is full of tiny bugs! Your goal is to fix this
  code so it correctly asks for the user's name and greets them properly. By the
  end, your virtual assistant will be able to say hello to anyone who uses it,
  just as it was meant to! Help your virtual assistant come to life by fixing
  the errors in the code. After debugging, it should ask for the user's name and
  print a warm greeting like:</p>
  <code>Hello, [name]! Welcome to scaffl.ed.</code>
